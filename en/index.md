The *“exégètes amateurs”* is the nickname given to a group of
activists litigating in France against mass surveillance, data
retention and State censorship on the Internet.

It is a joint initiative between [French Data Network][fdn] (France's oldest
internet access provider, since 1992), [La Quadrature du Net][lqdn] and the
[federation of non-profit ISPs (FFDN)][ffdn].
